In this project I used HTML and CSS to recreate a QR code component based on the given design.
I also used git to push to github.

Improvements:
After comparing my first solution with the given design, I found a few differences to correct. While making these corrections, I found that img elements are inline by default which caused there to be extra space between the img and the h1 underneath.
I also learned about HTML5 landmarks and their contribution to accessibility.
